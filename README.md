# Bike Helmet and Number Plate Detection 

This project aims to develop a real-time system for automatically detecting helmets and number plates on motorcycles in images or videos. It leverages the power of YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning object detection model, to achieve this objective.


## Features

- Object Detection to identify with Helment or without Helment
- Bounding Box Generation
- Class Labeling
- Number Plate Detection
